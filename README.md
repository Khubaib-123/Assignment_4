# Method 1: sortDescending(int[] arr)
This method sorts the input array in ascending order using Arrays.sort and then rearranges it in descending order

# Method 2: calculateStatistics(int[] arr)
This method calculates and returns an array with four statistical measures: median, variance, standard deviation, and sum of squares.

# Method 3: matrixMultiplication(int[][] matrixA, int[][] matrixB, int rowsA, int columnsA, int columnsB)
This method performs matrix multiplication of two matrices (matrixA and matrixB) and returns the result.

# Main Method:
This class demonstrates the usage of the methods from the CodeReuse class, showing how to sort an array in descending order, calculate statistics, and perform matrix multiplication.
